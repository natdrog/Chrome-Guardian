                <h1>Jack</h1>
                <p>Jack Thompson, the youngest. He can be sparatic at times, but 
                once it comes down to coding, he's all work. Mostly. Going into 
                his freshman year of high school at Toledo School for the Arts, 
                Jack indulges in technology-based activities in his spare time. 
                However, he also finds time to study Japanese and practice the 
                saxophone. In this project, Jack was a front-end developer on 
                the extension interface, and also slammed his head on his 
                keyboard for two hours to configure the server.</p>

                <p>Nathan Rogers, is an incomming Freshman at Perrysburg High 
                School.  And although he spends a lot of time on his computer, 
                he still makes room to practice his cello, which he is currently 
                in his fourth year of playing.  Throughout the project, Nathan 
                did both front-end as well as back-end programming.  It was his 
                job to bridge the gap between Jack and John doing front-end work 
                and Adam doing the behind the scenes work.</p>
